<h4>What Is It?</h4>
<p>The blockchain format was originally introduced as the backbone for a cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, but now we are beginning to realise that it has a much wider range of applications. A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a list of the transactions that have occurred with the currency on records called blocks. These blocks are secured from tampering and revision. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)</a>] It essentially acts as a ledger for transactions, recording transactions in a similar format to a regular ledger. Where it differs is how it functions.</p>

<h4>How Does It Work?</h4>
<p>The blockchain is written to by a large distributed peer to peer network which works together to validate transactions. When a transaction is requested, it is broadcast to the whole network along with a signature identifying the user, like a physical signature written on paper. The network itself consists of users of a platform, such as a cryptocurrency, and any applications associated with it. These applications allow them to do things such as store their digital assets or exchange them. Each node on the network adds that transaction to their copy of the latest block and forwards the transaction to other nodes.</p>
<p>The transaction record is compared between nodes to identify any discrepancies. If any are found, the changes are identified by comparing the signature of the original transaction to that of the altered one. The false changes are ignored. Once the block is complete, it is added to the end of the blockchain and made permanent and unalterable using cryptographic techniques.</p>

<h4>Issues</h4>
<p>The most prominent application of the blockchain system is with cryptocurrencies, a digital medium of exchange. They use system as a secure way of recording every transaction that occurs with their currency without requiring a central financial institution. [<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works" target="_blank">https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works</a>] Basic introductions or explanations to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can make them seen perfectly secure and without issues, but that is certainly not the case.</p>
<p>Creating more of a cryptocurrency involves a process called mining which is essentially just solving complex mathematical problems. The first to find the solution is rewarded with a set of new ‘coins’. Because of the intense difficulty of the problems being solved, many users choose to team up with others to form groups. Naturally as these problems get harder, the groups get larger. The issue here is that these groups could potentially get too big. Since each member of the group can contribute to validating transactions, if the group contains the majority of node on the blockchain network it becomes possible for them to add illegitimate transactions to the latest blocks. They could alter transaction requests and because more nodes would be comparing from the altered copy, the network would regard the original transaction as the illegitimate one, allowing one group of users to control the system.</p>
  
<p>As outlined by Dr Nicolas T. Courtois during a talk at UCL held by the UCLU Blockchain and Cryptographic technologies society, the transparent nature of the records created on the blockchain network have been its greatest downfall. From my interpretation of the talk, it seems that most of the problems that have occurred with Bitcoin are due to the openness of its blockchain records. Being able to see every transaction that has occurred along with the information of associated parties allows people to trace back every transaction they ever made and find how much that of the currency that user has. This information then be used to identify targets to attack directly through other means. Problems like this are being solved by newer cryptocurrencies, such as zcash, utilising protocols that allow users to make information like sender/recipient data and the amount of a transaction completely private.</p>

<h4>Research</h4>
<p>Research is being done on making blockchain systems as secure as possible. Making them resilient to constant attempts of attacks is a highly desirable feature, and providing anonymity in a system managed by anyone with a computer is equally important.</p>
<p>At the UCL Research Centre for Blockchain Technologies, research is being done on the development of blockchain technologies and the impact that distributed systems have on society, along with the risks emerging from these new innovations. More information about the bleeding edge research being done at UCL can be found at the website for the UCL CBT.</p>

<p>At the University of California, research has been done on classifying users of a blockchain system, namely Bitcoin wallet holders, by looking at spending habits. This classification data was then used to track longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market and the challenges face by those looking to perform malicious activities using Bitcoin.

<h4>Applications in the future</h4>
<p>As the blockchain format becomes more mature, we can expect to see robust security which should allow us to see adoption of the technologies from more people around the world. Building upon the fantastic research that has been done should allow businesses to operate internal transactions on decentralised systems while leaving room for innovation which they can share with the wider community. The Walt Disney Company has already begun working on their own blockchain technology with Dragonchain.</p>

<p>While the most popular use for blockchain technologies currently lie in the financial industry with cryptocurrencies, the uses of the format stretch much further. In the future we could see its use in public voting systems, to count votes, verify that everyone has votes, and reject illegitimate votes, or in the healthcare industry, to provide a secure way for healthcare providers to share up to date information on patients without the requirement of expensive centralised systems.</p>
