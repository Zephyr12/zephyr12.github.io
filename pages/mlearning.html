<h4> What Is Machine Learning? </h4>

<p>
Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, the core focus of
which is to reduce, or in some cases remove, the programming burden on
programmers and software designers by allowing computers and programs to learn
from a given data set. This is done by letting the computer analyse a large
amount of data and then using patterns found to make predictions about future
datasets. As well as reducing the effort needed to solve already know problems,
machine learning can also allow computers to solve problems that the programmer
themself had no idea how to solve such as analyse a human genome to find issues
that might cause an individual to be prone to cancer or analyse the stock
market that would allow trading companies to make millions in automated stock
market trading.

<h4> How Does Machine Learning Work? </h4>

<p>There are many different many different machine learning methods and new ones
are being developed and researched every day.
</p>

<p>Decision tree learning is what most people think of when they think of machine
learning. It works by building a list of "yes-no" questions based on a given
categorised data set, i.e. a data set where each data point had been given a
category. Consider a dataset that contained a few measurements about a stock
price such as it's current value, it's rate of change and the rate of change of
the rate of change. Each data point needs to then be categorised according to
whether it is better to buy or sell that stock, for example as stock with a low
current value that is going up in price at an increasing rate would be
classified as a "buy stock". The computer then goes through each of these data
points and builds a list of questions it can use such as "is the value under
£2.00" and "is the value going up by £1.00 per day" that it can use to classify
other data points that is fed and give info on whether to buy or sell.

</p>

<p>Another type of machine learning that is commonly used is something called an
artificial neural network, or an ANN. These usually consist of a simulated
network of neurones that work together to mimic the process that a human brain
takes when it solving a problem. One of sending fragments of the input data to
be processed in sub-neurons in something called a hidden layer, a constantly
shifting array of connections that recombine the data and perform the
computation that is needed. ANNs are useful as they build a decision
tree to categorise data on their own, without the programmer selecting
variables to base the decision around using something called the
Backpropagation algorithm which is used to deduce which neurones are faulty and
modifies that neuron's parameters in order to improve the output accuracy.  So
for example an ANN can be fed a list of stock values as input nodes which then
pass their values onto the hidden layer, which then combine these values and
pass them to the output node. This output is then checked and any error noted.
These errors are fed back into the Backpropagation algorithm which then
rearranges the neurones in the ANNs to reduce the error in the result.

<h4> Current Problems with Machine Learning </h4>
<p>
The first problem with machine learning and the reason manual programming was
exclusively for the majority of computer science's history is that an
inordinate amount of computing power is needed to run these programs in
anything but the most trivial cases but thanks to Moore's Law computing power
has grown exponentially. And by sending the computations across the internet
one can apparently perform staggering computations on devices smaller than a
small notebook.

<p>
Another problem with machine learning is the problem of overfitting. That is
what happens when an algorithm picks up more statistical noise than useful
information, for example with decision tree learning, the program might deduce
that all good trades "have a low starting value" but in fact all that is needed
for a good trade is to check if the "value is going up" and the "rate of
increase is not slowing down", this leads to false negatives in that it won't
detect good sales as it has not seen all of the possible stocks that it should buy.

<h4> Research Areas and Future Developments </h4>
<p>
Current research in this area is focused on trying to analyse larger datasets
in an area called Big Data. Analysing a larger datasets means that you can
reduce the chance of Overfitting and so produce more relevant and so profitable
results.

</p>

<p>
A large amount of computing power is needed to analyse these data sets and so a
method called distributed or cloud computing is being used where the
problem is being split up between many different smaller computers which can
then recombine them to produce useful insights into trends faster than would be
possible with traditional computing.

<h4> Future Applications </h4>

<p>
By definition, machine learning is the application of computing power to solve
problems the programmer themself had no idea how to. This means that the
applications of machine learning are almost endless ranging from detecting
malware to predicting stock and market trends. And the range of applications
will only grow as the amount of data that we have access to increases was well
as the rate at which it can be processed.
