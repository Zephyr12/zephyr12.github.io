<h4>What Is It?</h4>
<p>Broadly speaking, “Algorithmic Trading” involves using computers programmed with algorithms to trade stocks on the financial markets. However, exactly which parts the computer handles will depend on the definition used. In this article, we focus on High-Frequency Algorithmic Trading, which is usually indicated by companies that only hold stocks for very short periods of time, i.e. a stock is bought and sold on within milliseconds.</p>

<p>Having said that, there are other types of algorithmic trading. Some types involve using computers for only the execution part of a trade. An example application of this would be where a trader at an investment fund wanted to sell a large amount of one stock, but doesn’t want the market to catch on (as the price he could sell at would drop, because markets would become concerned if someone is getting rid of a large amount of one stock – this is called slippage). Instead, an algorithm could be programmed to split up the orders to sell into smaller orders, and time them throughout the day in accordance with normal market trends.</p>

<p>High Frequency Algorithmic Trading is a specific subset where computers perform all aspects of the trade from start to finish. They analyse market data in real-time (pre-trade analysis), make split-second decisions based on that data, before sending the order to the stock exchange in an efficient manner (trade execution). This allows trades to occur at a speed impossible for humans to rival. These computers can usually execute a trade in less than a millisecond, automatically, to achieve whatever they were programmed to do; for example, to “buy a stock when it falls below the average of its price the week before”. If they are the first company to buy, they can scoop up all of the stocks on offer for that price, before the increase in demand pushes up the price of the stock. <i>This is why being first is so important.</i></p>

<h4>Effects on The Real World</h4>
<p>High frequency algorithmic trading has both benefits and disadvantages to normal human traders. On one hand, they provide liquidity to a market by being a &quot;market maker&quot;. This means they keep trades happening (they’re happy to act as a buyer or seller of a stock, so human traders don’t need to sit around to wait for somebody to be willing to buy or sell). In other words, there are simply so many trades happening all the time (high frequency), that it’s very likely a computer will be selling around the same time you’d like to buy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is possible for them to go out of control, as while there is human oversight, things can often escalate too quickly for humans to properly intervene. An example would be Knight Capital’s incident on 1 August 2012. A piece of code intended only for debugging was accidentally deployed to live servers, that deliberately generated huge numbers of trades by "buying high and selling low" (the opposite of a sensible profit strategy, as you make a loss on every trade). The server did this with such speed that Knight Capital lost $440 million in just 30 minutes. The damage had been done before humans could identify and remedy the problem, the company had to be acquired soon after.</p>
<p>Another real world impact of the use of computers on stock exchanges is that trading can spiral out of control even when they work as expected. Called “flash crashes”, it’s possible for computers to start a chain of events that leads to a stock dropping in price. An example scenario is worked through below.</p>

<div class="well well-lg">
    <p class="text-center">

        <p>
        <b>A:</b> Some bad news appears about Company XYZ, so its stock begins dropping in price as humans try to sell any they own. Up to this point the average price of this stock was $1.45.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>B:</b> The stock falls below $1.30 ($0.15 lower than its average for the week before). Some risk-averse investment companies may have programmed their algorithms to believe it is risky to continue to hold, as it has lost quite a bit of its value. So these algorithms will begin automatically trying to sell any of this stock they hold.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>C:</b> The stock falls below $1.15 ($0.30 lower than its average for the week before). This triggers even more companies' algorithms to automatically begin selling the stock.</p>
        <p><i>All these companies trying to sell the same stock continues to force its price down.</i></p>
        <p><b>D:</b> Even the less risk-averse companies may now be getting worried, the stock has lost more than 30% its value. This triggers more and more algorithms to start selling the stock.</p>
        <p><b>E:</b> The more the price falls, the more algorithms that will try to shift a stock that is depreciating in value rapidly. By the end, it has lost 45% of its value, and this vicious circle may continue further.</p>

<h4>History</h4>
<p>Applying computers to model stocks has a long history, pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by programmers applying the theories Harry Markowitz developed in the preceding decade on Portfolio Theory. This quantified the risk of an investment, and could suggest to some degree the possible returns. As the decade continued, major changes were underway - the NYSE introduced DOT (Designated Order Turnaround), which allowed humans to enter orders directly to the person in charge of that stock on the floor, bypassing the need to phone a trader to then go and actually submit the order. This was the start of computers entering the stock buying/selling process - although it would be a long time before computers were considered for actually deciding whether to make a trade.</p>

<p>Probably the most important paper on this subject was IBM’s 2001 "Agent-Human Interactions in the Continuous Double Auction", which really laid the groundwork for software-based algorithmic trading, where programmed computers could decide what trades to make and how to execute them. IBM found "[their two pieces of trading software] are able to outperform non-expert human subjects by a clear margin." Since then the field has grown massively, with an estimated three-quarters of trades in the US now being made by computers.</p>

<h4>Research &amp; Future</h4>
<p>Investment companies are currently pouring money into creating more optimised algorithms that behave better in the real-world. Their research is ongoing to constantly tweak their algorithms to exploit their competitors’ flaws (i.e. if they’re too predictable); but also into optimising their algorithms to spot possible market trends more quickly to predict what may happen next.</p>

<p>In addition, many companies are focussing their efforts on getting every possible speed boost, as for some, every millisecond counts. In 2012, a $1.5 billion fibre-optic cable was built to reduce the time for a message (like a buy or sell order) to travel between London and Tokyo by just 60 milliseconds. That’s 20% of the time it takes you to blink! However, the very best high frequency algorithmic traders will actually “colocate” their servers in the same building as the stock exchange’s matching engine servers. This means there is such little distance for the order to travel, it can take place often in under a millisecond.</p>

<p>UCL has been very interested in furthering research in the area of Algorithmic Trading, for example having run competitions where PhD students compete to produce algorithms to make the most profit on a simulated market. Additionally, UCL's "Perspectives on High-Frequency Trading" research paper has looked at ways to reduce market volatilty and made recommendations that could change the way the markets are regulated.</p>
