<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Much of what we do today is underpinned by the financial industry. Whether you’re trading stocks or simply buying something off the internet, whatever you do, the financial industry has spent time and money developing systems to make sure everything you need to do works. Most, if not all of these systems rely on computers to perform their duty. Research in financial computing is therefore the backbone of modern society.</p>
<p>Here we’re going to be outlining key research areas within financial computing, detailing their importance and limitations, while discussing where they are heading with future research. Many of these topics involve technologies which will be leading the whole industry forward in the future as they develop, and many of the ideas discussed will be based off research done on bleeding edge technologies.</p>
<p>While the sub-areas of financial computing discussed here will be focused on research that has been conducted relatively recently, research in the field of financial computing spans a very long period of time, since the invention of the very first computers. Money has always driven the world, and so there was always a need to maximise the amount of money being made at any one point in time. Thus came the demand for financial services such as automated bookkeeping or personal money management systems. Research has moved on from the most trivial of systems to increasingly complicated solutions to challenging problems.</p>
