<h4>A Short History</h4>
<p>This area has its roots in the early 1950s, when Harry Markovitz used computers to put his portfolio theory into practice. A decade later, Ed Thorp, Michael Godkin, Harry Markovitz, Paul Samuelson, as well as Robert Merton further contributed to the development of this industry by first implementing arbitrage trading using computers. This involved exploiting differing prices for the same commodity across different markets, i.e. buying a stock at the cheapest market, and selling it where it was more expensive, to turn a profit relatively easily.</p>
<p>The field changed dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s, when financial computing moved its focus to options pricing and mortgage securities. The field flourished during this period as many new opportunities for the application of computers in finance emerged. In the early 1990s, after the Cold War, a large number of displaced mathematicians and physicists moved into the finance sector. This resulted in a wide range of new methods appearing in the world of finance with requirements for more powerful tools. In the last twenty years the available computational power has grown exponentially, and finance companies demand ever more skilled mathematicians and engineers to apply logic to Financial Computing.

<h4>Its Importance and Goals</h4>
<p>Much of what we do today is underpinned by the financial industry. Whether youʼre trading stocks or simply buying something off the internet - whatever you do, the financial industry has spent both time and money developing systems to ensure everything you need to use actually works. Most, if not all of these systems rely on computers to perform their duties. Research in financial computing is therefore the backbone of modern society. Here weʼre going to be outlining key research areas within financial computing, detailing their importance and limitations, while discussing where they are heading with future research.</p>

<p>Many of these topics involve technologies which will be leading the whole industry forward in the future as they develop, and many of the ideas discussed will be based off research done on bleeding edge technologies. While the sub-areas of financial computing discussed here will be focused on research that has been conducted relatively recently, research in the field of financial computing spans a very long period of time, reaching as far back as the invention of the very first computers. Money has always driven the world, and so there was always a need to maximise the amount of money being made at any one point in time. Thus came the demand for financial services such as automated bookkeeping or personal money management systems. Research has moved on from the most trivial of systems to increasingly complicated solutions for challenging problems.</p>
