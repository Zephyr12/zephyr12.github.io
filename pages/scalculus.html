<h4>What Is It?</h4>
<p>Stochastic Calculus is a branch of mathematics revolving around the idea of predicting random events. In the case of finance, this is especially useful with the stock market. Essentially, this area of research is mainly used for predicting where prices are going, allowing an individual to buy and sell with better timing through the use of a computer. The application of such technology is fairly self explanatory - it makes money for individuals and businesses alike.
</p>

<h4>How Does It Work?</h4>
<p>Here is a way to think about it. Consider a coin being flipped - there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails. The problem with guessing which side it lands on is the fact that it is random. Stock prices are fairly similar, as there are a limited number of outcomes, the price stays the same, it goes up, or it goes down. Moving back to the coin example, imagine if you knew all the formulae and data needed to model the motion of the coin. By looking at its rotation, how long it was in the air for, how it was caught etc. it would be entirely possible to work out which side the coin would land on. Working with this in mind, if you knew everything about what affects stock motion, you should be theoretically be able to do the same with them. By taking the price of the stock, how quickly it changes, its average return on investment and so on - a prediction for the future price of the stock can be outputted.</p>

<h4>Challenges With Using Stochastic Calculus</h4>
<p>Although this idea seems incredibly lucrative, the issue is getting this sort of modelling process to be accurate. Due to the mathematical nature of the data being used to calculate the future price, the predicted price that is output is actually a range of values. What this means is that the eventual value could either be much lower or much higher than the actual result. This range can also be calculated though, and therefore provides an upper and lower bound to the future price based on its past behaviour, which is still very useful. The issue of having this range can be minimised by reducing the range however, and this can be done by refining the model of motion used in the calculations.</p>

<h4>Research Areas</h4>
<p>The development of stochastic calculus and its application can only be a good thing, helping us to widen our knowledge of how financial systems work, as well as striving to further mathematics as a whole. Research on the topic is being carried out at many locations, here are a few examples of what they are doing:
Stochastic Calculus research at UCL largely looks at its other financial applications aside from its use in the stock market. Further information can be found in the following publications of UCL researchers:<br /><br />

Research is also being done at the University of Manchester on stochastic calculus, looking into ‘Option Pricing Theoryʼ, which involves studying where and when the application of stochastic calculus to a stock is the most profitable, focusing on creating a model to help with deciding when it is suitable.

<h4>Stochastic Calculus In The Future</h4>
<p>The idea that the stock market can be considered a stochastic process (something that can be predicted using this form of calculus) is still being developed. Through the use of pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms, the model of random motion used to predict stock prices can be progressively refined and adapted, reducing the margin of error and variance in the outputs of such calculations, increasing their effectiveness as more and more data is collected. Current research focuses largely on the collection of data and the identification of patterns among stocks and real world factors affecting their price. The future for this technology is potentially very bright and it may become the main method for raising capital for businesses and individuals in the future once the process becomes refined to the point to be extremely reliable.</p>
