<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The concept of portfolio theory was introduced in 1952 by the economist Harry Markovitz. Markovitz proved, using mathematical frameworks, that portfolio theory is the optimal method of investment and results in higher returns than any other solution. Earlier attempts had been made by Thomas Bayes, an English mathematician who published works, in 1763, in which he analysed probabilities relating investment. Later, Simon Laplace presented some practical applications of these probabilities in his 1812 publication “The Analytic Theory of Probabilities”. However, these works were not enough to be put into practice, until the further development of this work by Markowitz. This concept has led to huge changes in the field of finance.</p>

<h4>Why is it important?</h4>
<p>Portfolio theory revolves around making investments so that your portfolio consists of a diverse range of stocks, with money invested into multiple financial markets. This process was created in an effort to meet the wants of businessmen, who were generally focusing on investing money in a single direction. Even though this type of unidirectional investment proved to be profitable in some cases, it resulted in a negative return in many others.</p>

<h4>Research Areas</h4>
<p>Research relating the development of portfolio theory is presently being done at UCL. The article "Trading Optimally Diversified Portfolios in Emerging Markets with Neuro-Particle Swarm Optimisation" published on the UCL website mentions that a neural network can be trained to optimise the strategy of a portfolio. The result of this research proved that the presented strategy is effective for solving the portfolio optimisation problem in a realistic manner, without any negative impact. Another article entitled "Multi-objective Robustness for Portfolio Optimisation in Volatile Environments" points out an algorithm which minimises the risk to solve the real world problem of portfolio optimisation. However, this algorithm can be unstable, depending on the environment. The latter also goes on to show that this algorithm can dramatically affect companies depending on its implementation.</p>

<h4>The Future</h4>
<p>There are still aspects of portfolio theory which can be improved in the future. Risk is also dependant on the past experiences of an individual, so a general perception does not exist. Using theories that are currently being worked on however, the risk level will be able to be adapted depending on the type of portfolio that is desired. As well as this, it is impractical to assume that stocks act independently of other assets in the same portfolio - so a stable workaround to this issue is anticipated in the future.</p>
