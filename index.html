                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
                but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
                injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
                slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem
                Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
                hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on
                the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
                making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
                dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
                model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
                reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free
                from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words
                etc.

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
                also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
                essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
                more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
